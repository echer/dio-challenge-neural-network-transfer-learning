   "source": "# Transfer learning / fine-tuning\n\nThis tutorial will guide you through the process of using _transfer learning_ to learn an accurate image classifier from a relatively small number of training samples. Generally speaking, transfer learning refers to the process of leveraging the knowledge learned in one model for the training of another model.\n\nMore specifically, the process involves taking an existing neural network which was previously trained to good performance on a larger dataset, and using it as the basis for a new model which leverages that previous network's accuracy for a new task. This method has become popular in recent years to improve the performance of a neural net trained on a small dataset; the intuition is that the new dataset may be too small to train to good performance by itself, but we know that most neural nets trained to learn image features often learn similar features anyway, especially at early layers where they are more generic (edge detectors, blobs, and so on).\n\nTransfer learning has been largely enabled by the open-sourcing of state-of-the-art models; for the top performing models in image classification tasks (like from [ILSVRC](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/)), it is common practice now to not only publish the architecture, but to release the trained weights of the model as well. This lets amateurs use these top image classifiers to boost the performance of their own task-specific models.\n\n#### Feature extraction vs. fine-tuning\n\nAt one extreme, transfer learning can involve taking the pre-trained network and freezing the weights, and using one of its hidden layers (usually the last one) as a feature extractor, using those features as the input to a smaller neural net.\n\nAt the other extreme, we start with the pre-trained network, but we allow some of the weights (usually the last layer or last few layers) to be modified. Another name for this procedure is called \"fine-tuning\" because we are slightly adjusting the pre-trained net's weights to the new task. We usually train such a network with a lower learning rate, since we expect the features are already relatively good and do not need to be changed too much.\n\nSometimes, we do something in-between: Freeze just the early/generic layers, but fine-tune the later layers. Which strategy is best depends on the size of your dataset, the number of classes, and how much it resembles the dataset the previous model was trained on (and thus, whether it can benefit from the same learned feature extractors). A more detailed discussion of how to strategize can be found in [[1]](http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/) [[2]](http://sebastianruder.com/transfer-learning/).\n\n## Procedure\n\nIn this guide will go through the process of loading a state-of-the-art, 1000-class image classifier, [VGG16](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) which [won the ImageNet challenge in 2014](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/), and using it as a fixed feature extractor to train a smaller custom classifier on our own images, although with very few code changes, you can try fine-tuning as well.\n\nWe will first load VGG16 and remove its final layer, the 1000-class softmax classification layer specific to ImageNet, and replace it with a new classification layer for the classes we are training over. We will then freeze all the weights in the network except the new ones connecting to the new classification layer, and then train the new classification layer over our new dataset.\n\nWe will also compare this method to training a small neural network from scratch on the new dataset, and as we shall see, it will dramatically improve our accuracy. We will do that part first.\n\nAs our test subject, we'll use a dataset consisting of around 6000 images belonging to 97 classes, and train an image classifier with around 80% accuracy on it. It's worth noting that this strategy scales well to image sets where you may have even just a couple hundred or less images. Its performance will be lesser from a small number of samples (depending on classes) as usual, but still impressive considering the usual constraints.\n"

As our example, we will be using the dataset [CalTech-101](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/), which contains around 9000 labeled images belonging to 101 object categories. However, we will exclude 5 of the categories which have the most images. This is in order to keep the class distribution fairly balanced (around 50-100) and constrained to a smaller number of images, around 6000.\n\nTo obtain this dataset, you can either run the download script `download.sh` in the `data` folder, or the following commands:\n\n    wget http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/101_ObjectCategories.tar.gz\n    tar -xvzf 101_ObjectCategories.tar.gz\n\nIf you wish to use your own dataset, it should be aranged in the same fashion to `101_ObjectCategories` with all of the images organized into subfolders, one for each class. In this case, the following cell should load your custom dataset correctly by just replacing `root` with your folder. If you have an alternate structure, you just need to make sure that you load the list `data` where every element is a dict where `x` is the data (a 1-d numpy array) and `y` is the label (an integer). Use the helper function `get_image(path)` to load the image correctly into the array, and note also that the images are being resized to 224x224. This is necessary because the input to VGG16 is a 224x224 RGB image. You do not need to resize them on your hard drive, as that is being done in the code below.\n\nIf you have `101_ObjectCategories` in your data folder, the following cell should load all the data."

After the last pooling layer, we will attach a fully-connected layer with 256 neurons, another dropout layer, then finally a softmax classification layer for our classes.\n\nOur loss function will be, as usual, categorical cross-entropy loss, and our learning algorithm will be [AdaDelta](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5701). Various things about this network can be changed to get better performance, perhaps using a larger network or a different optimizer will help, but for the purposes of this notebook, the goal is to just get an understanding of an approximate baseline for comparison's sake, and so it isn't neccessary to spend much time trying to optimize this network.\n\nUpon compiling the network, let's run `model.summary()` to get a snapshot of its layers."

That's not too bad for 6000 images, considering that if we were to use a naive strategy of taking random guesses, we would have only gotten around 1% accuracy.\n\n## Transfer learning by starting with existing network\n\nNow we can move on to the main strategy for training an image classifier on our small dataset: by starting with a larger and already trained network.\n\nTo start, we will load the VGG16 from keras, which was trained on ImageNet and the weights saved online. If this is your first time loading VGG16, you'll need to wait a bit for the weights to download from the web. Once the network is loaded, we can again inspect the layers with the `summary()` method."

It contains 13 convolutional layers and two fully connected layers at the end, and has over 138 million parameters, around 100 times as many parameters than the network we made above. Like our first network, the majority of the parameters are stored in the connections leading into the first fully-connected layer.\n\nVGG16 was made to solve ImageNet, and achieves a [8.8% top-5 error rate](https://github.com/jcjohnson/cnn-benchmarks), which means that 91.2% of test samples were classified correctly within the top 5 predictions for each image. It's top-1 accuracy--equivalent to the accuracy metric we've been using (that the top prediction is correct)--is 73%. This is especially impressive since there are not just 97, but 1000 classes, meaning that random guesses would get us only 0.1% accuracy.\n\nIn order to use this network for our task, we \"remove\" the final classification layer, the 1000-neuron softmax layer at the end, which corresponds to ImageNet, and instead replace it with a new softmax layer for our dataset, which contains 97 neurons in the case of the 101_ObjectCategories dataset.\n\nIn terms of implementation, it's easier to simply create a copy of VGG from its input layer until the second to last layer, and then work with that, rather than modifying the VGG object directly. So technically we never \"remove\" anything, we just circumvent/ignore it. This can be done in the following way, by using the keras `Model` class to initialize a new model whose input layer is the same as VGG but whose output layer is our new softmax layer, called `new_classification_layer`. Note: although it appears we are duplicating this large network, internally Keras is actually just copying all the layers by reference, and thus we don't need to worry about overloading the memory."

But first, we need to freeze the weights and biases in all the layers in the network, except our new one at the end, with the expectation that the features that were learned in VGG should still be fairly relevant to the new image classification task. Not optimal, but most likely better than what we can train to in our limited dataset.\n\nBy setting the `trainable` flag in each layer false (except our new classification layer), we ensure all the weights and biases in those layers remain fixed, and we simply train the weights in the one layer at the end. In some cases, it is desirable to *not* freeze all the pre-classification layers. If your dataset has enough samples, and doesn't resemble ImageNet very much, it might be advantageous to fine-tune some of the VGG layers along with the new classifier, or possibly even all of them. To do this, you can change the below code to make more of the layers trainable.\n\nIn the case of CalTech-101, we will just do feature extraction, fearing that fine-tuning too much with this dataset may overfit. But maybe we are wrong? A good exercise would be to try out both, and compare the results.\n\nSo we go ahead and freeze the layers, and compile the new model with exactly the same optimizer and loss function as in our first network, for the sake of a fair comparison. We then run `summary` again to look at the network's architecture."
